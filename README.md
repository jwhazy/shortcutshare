# ShortcutShare

Small program to upload and download files via HTTP. My original problem was that I had no way to **quickly** send and receive files to/from my phone. After getting it to this state I then realised that "snapdrop" exists and it solved all my problems ;(. This code is my effort of learning Go, it is not "clean" and could be improved. Have a look around, I would strongly advise you to not use this on a insecure/public network.
